Studies show that for every additional year in school, girls are better able to make healthy decisions related to sexual behavior and the well-being of their future families. An increase in physical infrastructure is an essential prerequisite to increased enrollment. In partnership with the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MoEST) of the Government of Malawi, USAID/Malawi is implementing the Secondary Education Expansion for Development project (SEED). SEED looks to address this lack of secondary school infrastructure and make secondary schools more accessible.The SEED Project will be implemented in two phases:SEED Phase 1: Phase 1 is the design-build construction of pre-fabricated (pre-fab) classroom blocks and latrines, at 33 Malawi urban community day secondary schools (CDSSs) in Blantyre, Zomba, Lilongwe, and Mzuzu. These blocks will reduce overcrowding in existing CDSSs. One to two classroom blocks and a latrine will be constructed on approved land at operational CDSSs. Phase 2 will involve the construction of new “greenfield” CDSS facilities in rural areas where historically secondary school access has been limited. The total number of sites will be determined based on potential construction costs of individual schools; however, it is anticipated that approximately 185 new secondary schools will be constructed.CDM Smith is currently searching for an experienced Design Manager.
